# Scrum Cheat Sheet

Short cheat sheet about Scrum, based on [The 2020 Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html).

## Scrum Guide

 - First Scrum Guide in 2010
 - "Developer" includes everyone (Engineer, Tester, Architect ...)

## Scrum

- Developed in the early 1990
- Lightweight **framework**
- Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum covers up problems and limits the benefits
- Helps generate value through **adaptive solutions** for **complex problems**
- The **Scrum Master** fosters an environment where:
	1. A **Product Owner** orders the work for a **complex problem** into a **Product Backlog**.
	2. The **Scrum Team** turns a selection of the work into an **Increment** of value during a **Sprint**.   
	3.  The **Scrum Team** and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
	4.  **Repeat**
- Simple and incomplete
- Founded on **empiricism** and lean thinking
- Iterative and incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk

## The Empirical Pillars

Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within the Sprint. These events work because they implement the empirical Scrum pillars of **transparency, inspection, and adaptation**.

### Transparency

- The process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work
- Transparency enables inspection
- Inspection without transparency is misleading and wasteful

### Inspection

- The Scrum artifacts and goals must be inspected frequently to detect problems.
- Inspection enables adaptation
- Inspection without adaptation is pointless

### Adaptation

- If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, adjustments must be made.
- Adjustment must be made **as soon as possible** to minimize further problems
- Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing

## Scrum Values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values:

**Commitment** to achieving the goals and support each other.
**Focus** on the work of the Sprint to make the best possible progress.
**Open** about the work and the challenges.
**Respect** for each other to be capable and independent people.
**Courage** to do the right thing and to work on tough problems.

## Scrum Team

- Fundamental unit of Scrum
- Consists of 1 Scrum Master,  1 Product Owner and Developers (<= 10ppl)
- No sub-teams or hierarchies
- Focused on the Product Goal
- Self-managing and has all skills necessary to create value each Sprint
- Multiple cohesive Scrum Teams share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, Product Owner and Definition of Done
- The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities
- The Product Owner and Scrum Master can also be Developers

### Developers

- Creating a usable increment
- Creating the **Sprint Backlog**
- Adhering to a Definition of Done

### Product Owner

- Accountable for maximizing the value of the product
- Developing the **Product Goal**
- Creating and ordering **Product Backlog** items

### Scrum Master

- Accountable for the Scrum Teamâ€™s **effectiveness**
- Accountable for establishing **Scrum**
- Leading, training and coaching

## Scrum Events

- All events are held at the same time and place to **reduce complexity**
- Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts

### The Sprint

- Fixed length, one month or less
- A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
- A Sprint could only be cancelled by the Product Owner and only if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.

### Sprint Planning

- Done by whole Scrum Team
- Possible to invite experts
- 8 hours for a one month sprint

#### 1. Why is this Sprint valuable?

- The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility.
- The whole Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal.

#### 2. What can be Done this Sprint?

- The Developers select items from the Product Backlog through discussion with the Product Owner
- The Scrum Team may refine these items at this point

#### 3. How will the chosen work get done?

- Planning the work needed for every item (estimation of complexity)
- The Developers decompose items into work items of one day or less
- Work items need to meet the Definition of Done

### Daily Scrum

- 15 minutes
- Held by the Developers
- Inspect progress
- Adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary

### Sprint Review

- maximum 4 hours for a one month Sprint
- The Scrum Team presents the results
- Determine future adaptations
- The Product Backlog may be adjusted

### Sprint Retrospective

- maximum 3 hours for a one month sprint
- The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done
- Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness
- Adapting the Definition of Done

## Scrum Artifacts

- Represents work or value
- Designed to maximize transparency
- Each artifact contains a commitment

### Product Backlog

- Committed to the Product Goal
- The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team.
- Ordered list of what is needed to improve the product
- Product Backlog refinement is an ongoing activity

### Sprint Backlog

- Committed to the Sprint Goal
- composed of:
	-  the Sprint Goal (why), 
	- set of Product Backlog items (what)
	- an plan for delivering the Increment (how)
- Updated throughout the Sprint
- Enough detail to inspect the progress in the Daily Scrum

### Increment

- Committed to the Definition of Done
	- The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality 		measures required for the product.
- Provides value, is usable
- Additive to all prior Increments
- Consist only of work that meets the Definition of Done
- Can be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the sprint
- An item that doesn't meat the Definition of Done returns to the Product Backlog
- The Scrum Teams define one Definition of Done
